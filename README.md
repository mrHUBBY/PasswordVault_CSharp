# PasswordVault 

A password vault manager app created for the Windows desktop (though it should work on any tablets running the Windows OS).
Supports a tree view hierarchy where each entry contains a 'category' and a 'title' to help organize your vault entries.
Add/delete/edit as many items as you need.  Click on an entries 'URL' button to invoke an instance of your preferred 
Internet app while at the same time autmoatically navigating to the web-page associated with your vault entry (if there is one).
Utility buttons allow for the easy pasting of your username/password data into the web-page. Searh feature allows for the
quick retrieval of a specific vault entry.  All vault data is encrypted with 128-bit encryption to protect your data
from any intruders.
